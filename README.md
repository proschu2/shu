## Shu - generator of untranslatable words

![shu](shu.jpg)

Based on an idea coming from [Eppure Cadiamo Felici](https://www.amazon.com/Eppure-cadiamo-felici-Italian-Galiano-ebook/dp/B06XSGYM2W), an Italian book by Enrico Galiano, where the main character has a passion for untranslatable words in the various languages. My girlfriend is a fan of the book, so I made this as a surprise for her. After the release of volume two, [Felici Contro il Mondo](https://www.amazon.it/Felici-contro-mondo-Enrico-Galiano/dp/8811815401), also the words contained there were added to the generator, taking the total to almost 200.
