Based on an idea coming from [Eppure Cadiamo Felici](https://www.amazon.com/Eppure-cadiamo-felici-Italian-Galiano-ebook/dp/B06XSGYM2W), an Italian book by Enrico Galiano, where the main character has a passion for untranslatable words in the various languages. My girlfriend is a fan of the book, so I made this as a surprise for her.
